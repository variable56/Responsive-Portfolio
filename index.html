                    I am not your typical coder. My background is in accounting and I am a CPA. Boring right? Not usually.
                    The thing is, there is alot of stigma with the profession that isn't merited. Accountants are in high demand and are
                    challenged everyday with different things much like developers are. I have a family of 5 kids and love
                    every minute at home. I am also a huge geek with varying interests ranging from mountain biking,
                    fishing, comics, building and repairing computers, and ofcourse video games.

                    I have loved my profession and will always want it to be an emphasis in my career. That said, I am
                    always looking for ways to expand and keep up in pace to the rapidly changing world we live in. I first
                    ventured into coding through a love of SQL I developed while working with it in my job. It is
                    fascinating the way in which data is stored and then presented back to the user in a meaningful way. My
                    hope is that I can use my coding skills to identify needs, interpret them, and create customized and
                    meaningful solutions to solve them.
